Three important parameters:

Support - How popular an item/product is? The proportion of transactions in which the item appears

Confidence - How likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased

Lift - How likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased while controlling how popular item Y is

Lift > 1 is considered to be good
